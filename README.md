Project: Blog API
=============

A RESTful API written in Node.js for a blog. 

This API is used in [this website.](https://odin-react-blog.vercel.app/)

You can also visit the front-end repository by [clicking here.](https://github.com/alansobchacki/odin-react-blog)


Disclaimer
-----

This was the first API I've ever built, as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community so that other students can learn from the same project stages.

Also, as directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on the requirements of the project.


About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) curriculum. It is the sixth project required for completion of the NodeJS Course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Develop a schema that handles posts, comments, and users.
- [x] Set up your routes and controllers following RESTful guidelines. 
- [x] Protect sensitive routes using authentication and tokens.
- [x] Once your API is working you can focus on your front-end code. Technically this is a backend focused course so if you would prefer, feel free to focus on the REST API.


What I Learned
-----

In this project, I learned how to work with an ORM (namely Prisma), setting up an authentication system with JSON Web Tokens, writing requests and responses that are suitable for APIs, the basics of writing RESTful APIs, and how to properly make requests from a front-end system to an API.


Notes
-----

This project is currently being hosted on the following platforms:

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (the front-end website)
[Render](https://render.com/) (the API)
[Neon](https://neon.tech/) (the database)

As of today (11/10/24), this website is completely operational. This project is live thanks to the help and support of the companies above, who provide excellent free-trial services. 

Should this project become unresponsive or offline, it's most likely due to a change on the business plans of any of these providers. We all got bills to pay, so no judgement.
